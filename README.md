Inspired by Matt Parker's Numberphile video, "What's special about 277777788888899?"

The video for Matt Parker's explaination can be found here:

In short, multiplicative persistence is the number of times you can multiply the digits in a number together, and repeat that again with the result, until you reach a single digit number. For example, the number 68889 will last for 7 steps:
6 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 9 = 27648
2 x 7 x 6 x 4 x 8 = 2688
2 x 6 x 8 x 8 = 768
7 x 6 x 8 = 336
3 x 3 x 6 = 54
5 x 4 = 20
2 x 0 = 0
